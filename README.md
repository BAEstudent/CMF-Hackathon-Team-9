# CMF-Hackathon-Team-9

This is the Git repository for Team 9 hackathon solution. It consists of several files:
- `Sber_hack_final_part_1.ipynb`,
- `task 2, delay correction.ipynb`,
- `Hackathon_Problem_3_Solution.ipynb`,
which are solutions for the hackathon taks from 1 to 3 respectively.

### Tasks Solutions

- The num_orders_pred(orders_file) receives a file with the demand data as input, and returns a pandas DataFrame with date indices for the following week (starting from the last date in the input file) and columns consisting of predicted numbers of orders for each delivery area ('delivery_id_area') from 0 to 592.
 XGBoost library was used for learning, using time series cross-validation.

- Task 3 was solved using the mixed-integer programming, minimizing the total number of working hours. For details, please refer to `Task_3_Solution_Design.pdf`, which contains the description of the solution for this task.

### Other

There are also several other files. 
- `couriers distribution.ipynb` is the code used for preparing the dataset (addind new features and cleaning the data) for the ML part.

- `Shifts.py` is the module for solving the 3-rd task of the hackathon, consists of a function `find_shifts(Demand)`, which takes the input from the model used for task 2, and outputs two variables: a list of shift schedules, and the list of total couriers reuqired on each day.

- 'Task_3_Solution_Design.pdf` is a pdf file, containing the discription of the task 3 solution.
